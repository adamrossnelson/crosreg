# crossreg
## Introduction
This project is designed to provide an applied crosswalk between Stata, R, and Python. Other crosswalks provide a list of columns with equivalent code snippits. This crosswalk aims to provide similar projects in different environments. Aside from being useful as a crosswalk this project can be useful in teaching and/or learning first semester statistics.

First demonstrates and implements correlation calculations in each environment. See the file series `coorhandStata.do coorhandPy.py corrhandR.r`. In Stata enter the following command for a demonstration (no downloads necessary):

```
do https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/crossreg/master/corrhandStata.do
```
In R use the following command for a demonstration (no downloads necessary):
```
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/crossreg/master/corrhandR.r")
```

Second, demonstrates/Implements OLS regression calculations in each environment. See the file series `reghandStata.do reghandPy.py reghandR.r`.
